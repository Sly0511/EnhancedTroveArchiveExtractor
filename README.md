# EnhancedTroveArchiveExtractor
This project aims at automating the process of extraction of Trove Game Files and speeding up further extractions by using Hashing to filter unchanged files

## Important note
Windows is quite annoying with it's anti malware software, it may slow down significantly the extraction process to have antivirus on, it is not required to disable, but doing so will speed up the process.

## Windows or browser is saying it's a virus
Unfortunately windows is strict with what it wants to run.
The exe file isn't signed with a certificate, so Windows will say it's a virus regardless, unless you have dev certificates in your machine.

Best way around this is:
  - Open Windows Security
  - Go to Virus and Threat Protection
  - Disable Real Time Protection
  - You can reenable once you are done with running the program.
  - Regardless if you forget it will re enable itself shortly, windows will force it on eventually.
